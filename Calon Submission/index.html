                <h2>Coding</h2>
                The coding is the process of transforming the design of a system into a computer language format. This
                coding phase of software development is concerned with software translating design
                specification into the source code. It is necessary to write source code & internal documentation so
                that conformance of the code to its specification can be easily verified.

                Coding is done by the coder or programmers who are independent people than the designer. The goal is not
                to reduce the effort and cost of the coding phase, but to cut to the cost of a later stage.
                The cost of testing and maintenance can be significantly reduced with efficient coding.

                <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
                Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of
                software.
                <br>
                <br>
                When the first digital computers appeared in the early 1940s the instructions to make them operate were
                wired
                into the machine. Practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the
                "stored program architecture" or von Neumann architecture.
                Thus the division between "hardware" and "software" began with abstraction being used to deal with the
                complexity of computing.

                Software engineering (SE) is the profession concerned with specifying, designing, developing and
                maintaining software applications by
                applying technologies and practices from computer science, project management, and other fields.
                <br>
                <br>
                SE applications are used in a wide range of activities, from industry to entertainment. Software
                applications improve user productivity and quality of life. Application software examples: office
                suites, video games, and the world wide web.
                System software examples: embedded systems and operating systems.

                <h2>Data Science</h2>
                <div>
                    Data science is a multidisciplinary approach to extracting actionable insights from the large and
                    ever-increasing volumes of data collected and created by today’s organizations. Data science
                    encompasses preparing data for analysis and processing, performing advanced data analysis, and
                    presenting the results to reveal patterns and enable stakeholders to draw informed conclusions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Data preparation can involve cleansing, aggregating, and manipulating it to be ready for specific
                    types of processing. Analysis requires the development and use of algorithms, analytics and AI
                    models. It’s driven by software that combs through data to find patterns within to transform these
                    patterns into predictions that support business decision-making. The accuracy of these predictions
                    must be validated through scientifically designed tests and experiments. And the results should be
                    shared through the skillful use of data visualization tools that make it possible for anyone to see
                    the patterns and understand trends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Open source technologies are widely used in data science tool sets. When they’re hosted in the
                    cloud, teams don’t need to install, configure, maintain, or update them locally. Several cloud
                    providers also offer prepackaged tool kits that enable data scientists to build models without
                    coding, further democratizing access to the innovations and insights that this discipline is making
                    available.

                <h2>Cloud</h2>
                Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include
                tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cloud computing is named as such because the information being accessed is found remotely in the cloud
                or a virtual space. Companies that provide cloud services enable users to store files and applications
                on remote servers and then access all the data via the Internet. This means the user is not required to
                be in a specific place to gain access to it, allowing the user to work remotely.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cloud computing can be both public and private. Public cloud services provide their services over the
                Internet for a fee. Private cloud services, on the other hand, only provide services to a certain number
                of people. These services are a system of networks that supply hosted services. There is also a hybrid
                option, which combines elements of both the public and private services.

                                focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn

                                but was renamed to the iOS in June, 2009. The iOS currently runs on the iPhone, iPod

                                Programming for iOS is primarly done using either Swift or Objective-C which is also
